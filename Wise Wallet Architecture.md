# Wise Wallet Architecture

The above diagram shows how the entity, a user, is related to a transaction document and a survey document. We are currently using the Firestore database, which is a NoSQL database, meaning there are no relations, but there are simple relationships, like one user has many transactions. The way we are "connecting" the documents and the profile is through the user's unique identifier, which is made upon account creation. In the ER diagram above, one user can have many transactions which include the user_id (to connect to the user), transaction_id, amount, date, and description. This is because one user can make many transactions. Additionally, the survey data is a one-to-one relationship including the user's first and last name, college and graduation information, budgeting information, contact number, and notification preferences. One user can have only one survey since it is part of the registration process (as a secondary to email/password authentication sign-up), and one survey is connected to only one user. Additionally, when a user wants to update their profile, selected information is taken from the user authentication realtime database (email) and the survey document (user_id,﻿ email﻿, firstName, lastName, college, graduationDate, phoneNumber, notificationPreferences﻿, notificationMethod﻿) to update the same user via their unique identifier. NOTE: phoneNumber is currently being integrated in the next iteration, so this reflects a future entity relationship diagram.
